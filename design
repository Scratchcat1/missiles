Physical Object:
    position
    velocity
    weight

    angle

Explosion
    Damage
    current radius

All objects are either free or stored in another object:
    if stored in another object all top level object effect affect lower levels e.g. damage/move/collide/accelerate
    If an object is launched e.g. missile/warhead it becomes a top level object
    If any object is damaged it damages the subcomponents to, if a warhead is damaged it may detonate, detonating warheads are made top level objects
            
            
    updateKinetics is the inactive version of move, the caller of updateKinetics is in control.

Viewer:
    takes information or state (A world object) and draws this information;
    Either:
        take a world object and extract each object and render individually
        or
        convert all world objects into descriptive objects (i.e. type, location, children etc. ) in a tree

    Convert coordinates into screen coordiantes.
