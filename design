All objects are either free or stored in another object:
    if stored in another object all top level object effect affect lower levels e.g. damage/move/collide/accelerate
    If an object is launched e.g. missile/warhead it becomes a top level object
    If any object is damaged it damages the subcomponents to, if a warhead is damaged it may detonate, detonating warheads are made top level objects
